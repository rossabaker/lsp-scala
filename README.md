# DEPRECATED - lsp-scala

`lsp-scala` is now part of [lsp-mode] as `lsp-metals`. Please do not use this package.

Scala support for [lsp-mode], mainly focus on [metals].

## Installation

Installation instructions with [metals] are available here: https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/emacs.html

#### Other Scala language servers

Other Scala language servers should work in theory.  The easiest way,
if your server launches from the command line, is to customize
`lsp-scala-server-command` and `lsp-scala-server-args`.

## Does it work?

metals describes itself as "work in progress".  Temper your expectations, cheer them on, and [help if you can](https://github.com/scalameta/metals/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).  Though many lsp-mode features are not yet implemented, those that are appear to be working well.  Kudos to the metals team.

Some of this is too nuanced to fit in a boolean.  Some of this may be me my misunderstanding.  More user experience reports welcome.
